# Sales Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard that analyzes sales performance, providing insights into revenue trends, product performance, regional sales distribution, and customer behavior. The dashboard was built using Tableau for visualization.

The dashboard consists of two views that can be toggled using buttons:
- **Sales Dashboard :** Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total quantity sold, and total profit. It also includes sales and profit breakdowns by sub-category and sales/profit trends over time.
- **Customer Dashboard :** Focuses on customer metrics, including total customers, total sales per customer, total orders, customer distribution by number of orders, and the top 10 customers by profit.
